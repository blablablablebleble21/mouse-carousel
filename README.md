# 🟣Mouse quick pannel carousel

This carousel is for any mouse with a spare key button, or a combination of keboard presses(see below).

# 🚀 Key Features

Radial Navigation: 6-sector interactive ring that includes:

1. Setting opener.
2. Spotify opener.
3. Paste the lest copied item(s).
4. Copy the marked item(s).
5. Switch to last opened tab.
6. Snapshot the screen.  
  
  
Hardware Macro Ready: Optimized to be triggered via a set of keys (using the Control + ; hotkey by default).

Invisible Interaction: The system cursor is hidden while the ring is active, focusing the user's attention entirely on the action slices.

Smart Focus Hand-off: Automatically restores focus to the underlying application before executing simulated keystrokes like Copy or Paste.

# 🛠 Developer Setup (JS Version)
For those wanting to run the js code code:

Install VS 2022 version here: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_community.exe

MAKE SURE YOU INSTALL THE "Desktop developement with C++"!

Run installation.bat.

Run launch.vbs

Try pressing "ctrl + ;" Did it work? Congradutations! the carousel is now yours! If not then try re-runnning the steps above.

If you want the carousel to be opened from a mouse button then you need to configure that button in your mouse HUB. I will make a nicer app that controlls everything in the future, but this is for now :)
