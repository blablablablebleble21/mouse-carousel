Establishing your intent: You want a professional and aesthetically pleasing README.md file for your project, reflecting its recent transition from Electron (JavaScript) to C# (.NET 8/9).

🟣 Mouse Carousel (Actions Ring)
A high-performance, radial quick-action menu designed for power users and accessibility. Originally built with Electron, the project is now evolving into a native C# application to eliminate resource overhead and hardware notification glitches.

🚀 Key Features
Radial Navigation: 6-sector interactive ring optimized for muscle memory.

Precision Cursor Lock: Confines the mouse within the ring upon activation to ensure 100% selection accuracy.

Hardware Macro Ready: Optimized to be triggered via Logitech G502 X G-keys using the Control + ; hotkey.

Invisible Interaction: The system cursor is hidden while the ring is active, focusing the user's attention entirely on the action slices.

Smart Focus Hand-off: Automatically restores focus to the underlying application before executing simulated keystrokes like Copy or Paste.
